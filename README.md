# Space Jetters
---

## How It Works

1. Signup to make a Space Jetters account or login to an existing account.
2. Explore the “destinations” page to view the options that are offered by Space Jetters to get an idea of where you would like to travel to.
3. Click the “proceed” button for a given destination to go to that destination page.
4. View details about the trip to your selected destination, such as:
    - Travel time
    - Number of Earth days per day at the given location
    - Distance from Earth
    - Required training time
    - Other things included with your Space Jetters purchase.
5. Select the desired date you would like to depart for your trip as well as the size of your crew. Crew size ranges from 1 to 5 persons.
6. Next, hit the “checkout” button, which will take you to the payments page ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-ca)).
7. Fill in your payment information, then confirm your payment to book your trip!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
