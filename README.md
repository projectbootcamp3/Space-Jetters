    - Distance from Earth
    - Required training time
    - Other things included with your Space Jetters purchase.
5. Select the desired date you would like to depart for your trip as well as the size of your crew. Crew size ranges from 1 to 5 persons.

## Link to the deployed application
https://space-jetters.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

Copy the link to the repo (either HTTP or SSH link above), the paste it after entering the git clone command in 

### 1. Create a new directory using `mkdir <Directory_Name>`.
### 2. `cd` into the newly created directory.
### 3. Run `git clone <GitHub_Repo>` to clone the remote repo to your newly created directory on your computer. 

## Available Scripts

Once the project is cloned into the directory you created, you should run:

### 1. In the root directory of the project, run `npm install` to download the required packages for starting the server and client.

### 2. `cd` into the **client* directory, then run `npm install` to download the required packages. When done, return to the root directory.

### 3. `cd` into the **server* directory, then run `npm install` to download the required packages. When done, return to the root directory.

### 3. Finally, use the command `npm run develop` to concurrently start the [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [React Client](https://reactjs.org/) in "development mode".

The page will reload when you make changes due to the **nodemon** package that is installed within the server directory.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
